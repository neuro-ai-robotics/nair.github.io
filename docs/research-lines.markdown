## Neuroscience-inspired Artificial Intelligence

This research line focuses on developing AI systems inspired by the complexity and efficiency of the human brain. By delving into neuroscience, researchers aim to create algorithms and models that mimic human cognitive functions, potentially transforming fields like healthcare, robotics, and natural language processing. The goal is to leverage neural computation principles to build AI systems that are more adaptive, efficient, and capable of tackling complex challenges, bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence and opening new frontiers in machine learning and decision-making processes. For instance, we are experts in predictive coding accounts for perception and action (i.e., active inference).
