[//]:* [Research Lines](#research-lines)

The Neuroscience-inspired Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (NAIR) research group belongs to the [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/en/csic). Our research transforms our understanding of the brain into future technologies. It aims to improve artificial intelligence and robotic systems by studying how humans perceive and interact with their bodies, while also uncovering the internal mechanisms of information processing in the brain. We develop novel algorithms for learning, estimation, and control of complex systems based on findings from neuroscience, and evaluate them on robotic platforms (humanoids, manipulators, exoskeletons). Our models are not only relevant to disciplines such as computational neuroscience, robotics, and cognitive science, but also have practical applications in human-centered solutions such as healthcare, human-robot interaction, wearable robotics, and more. Our goal is to achieve human-like embodied intelligence in robots, <ins>enabling them to act and adapt to complex real-world interactions, which is one of the key challenges of this century</ins>.

**Experience:** Our research group has over ten years of experience in brain-inspired machine learning models for robot perception and action. We have been pioneers in successfully deploying neuroscience-inspired models (e.g., predictive coding) on humanoid robots, as well as replicating experiments of human perception on robotic systems (e.g., rubber hand illusion). We are internationally recognized for our active inference approach to robotics, which is a framework inspired by neuroscience that describes the brain as an inference machine. Currently, we are investigating new theoretical probabilistic models for practical applications in industrial robotics, environmental monitoring, and healthcare.

### Artificial Intelligence Inspired by Neuroscience

This research line focuses on developing AI systems inspired by the complexity and efficiency of the human brain. By delving into neuroscience, researchers aim to create algorithms and models that mimic human cognitive functions, potentially transforming fields like healthcare, robotics, and natural language processing. The goal is to leverage neural computation principles to build AI systems that are more adaptive, efficient, and capable of tackling complex challenges, bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence and opening new frontiers in machine learning and decision-making processes.

### Robotic Learning (RL for Wearable Robotics)

The integration of machine learning with robotics in the context of wearable technology forms the basis of this research line. It emphasizes the development of personalized assistive devices that adapt to and learn from the user's movements and intentions through reinforcement learning and human-robot interaction techniques. Such advancements could significantly enhance the quality of life for individuals with disabilities, offering improved mobility and independence, as well as providing innovative solutions in healthcare for rehabilitation and the recovery of motor functions.

### Spiking Control

Spiking Control explores the potential of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in creating more efficient and robust control algorithms for a variety of applications, from autonomous vehicles to smart manufacturing. SNNs, which replicate the neuronal firing patterns found in the brain, promise to enhance the adaptability and performance of control systems. This research line aims to merge neuroscience with control theory to revolutionize how systems respond to dynamic environments and complex stimuli, fostering advancements in robotics and industrial automation.

### Computational Models of Body Perception


This research area aims to replicate and understand the human perception of one's own body through computational models, addressing the integration of sensory information to form a unified self-image. Such models have profound implications for virtual reality, enhancing user immersion by improving the sense of embodiment, and for robotics, in designing machines that understand their physicality better. Furthermore, these insights can contribute to healthcare, offering new therapeutic options for conditions like phantom limb pain or body dysmorphia, by advancing our understanding of body representation and schema.

### Self-Perception and Synthetic Consciousness


Self-Perception and Synthetic Consciousness is a cutting-edge research area that explores the fascinating realm of artificial consciousness and the perception of self in Focusing on the frontier of artificial consciousness, this research line investigates the possibility of instilling a sense of self-awareness in machines. It explores computational approaches to mimic human self-perception, aiming to understand and recreate the elements of consciousness in artificial systems. The implications are vast, potentially leading to intelligent systems that can engage empathetically and understand human emotions and intentions, marking a significant leap towards bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence and redefining interactions with technology.
